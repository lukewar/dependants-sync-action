# ðŸš€ Dependants Sync Action

Automates the synchronization of fields in GitHub Projects between parent issues and their dependents.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

2. Add the following secrets to your repository:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub token with project access.
   - `PROJECT_URL` - The URL of your GitHub Project.
   - `SYNC_FIELDS` - Comma-separated list of single select fields to synchronize.
